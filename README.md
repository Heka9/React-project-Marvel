## Pet project on React!
The main goal of this project is to show various concepts and my best practices as React developer. 

It's a small MPA (3 pages), created with React 18 (has light transitions and fetch data.)

The project is available by following link: https://marveltestreact.vercel.app

### Features:

- At the top part of the main page, you can see a random character card and button for choosing another character (all data is uploaded by API).
- A little lower a list with random characters, all cards are interactive, new cards are uploaded by scrolling down (to increase productivity and smooth appearance, using the debounce function and transitions library)
- Header has active links, which follow to page with all comics (uploading by 8 items, use smooth transition too) and on all characters.
- Page navigation implemented by React Router DOM 6
- During the creation of this app, worked with functional components. The main focus was on using custom hooks to optimize and structure the code so that the application can scale. In work stick to SOLID principles.
